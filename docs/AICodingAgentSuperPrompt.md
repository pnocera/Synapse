# Synapse Agent Wake-Up Pointer

The full internal agent doctrine is intentionally not tracked in this public
docs tree. It was removed from `docs/` in commit `390cfe4` when internal
planning/specification documents were moved out of the public repo.

Authoritative wake-up sources for agents on this configured host:

1. `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.
2. `C:\Users\hotra\Downloads\AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`.
3. Open GitHub issues and closed `type:decision` / `type:context` issues,
   especially #351.

Manual FSV remains mandatory. Do not substitute scripts, tests, benchmarks,
harnesses, CI, GitHub Actions, direct HTTP helpers, or direct storage writes for
real Synapse MCP tool triggers when a Synapse MCP tool exists. If the configured
Codex `mcp__synapse` bridge is closed, stale, or missing, treat that as local
host setup work and repair it before accepting Synapse runtime behavior.
