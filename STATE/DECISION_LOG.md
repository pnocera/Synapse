# DECISION LOG - Synapse

- 2026-05-31: Established active objective from operator request: complete and resolve all open GitHub issues in `chrisroyse/synapse`.
- 2026-05-31: Queue read found four open issues: #590, #589, #588, #585.
- 2026-05-31: Chose to continue #589 first because the worktree already contains partial hardware-HID removal progress matching the issue comment.
- 2026-05-31: Reconciled post-compaction state: hardware-HID removal is already in local commit `e0e9993`; remaining #589 work is stale systemspec docs plus manual runtime/client-parity FSV.
- 2026-05-31: Cleaned systemspec and PRD/impplan stale live hardware-HID references. Decided #589 FSV must launch a repo-built runtime because existing `synapse-mcp` processes are installed binaries and not proof of the local commit.
- 2026-05-31: Fixed signed profile package manifest test expectation after hardware-metadata removal changed the deterministic signature payload digest.
- 2026-05-31: Completed #589 manual FSV through the repo-built HTTP daemon using official MCP Inspector CLI for strict tools/list/client-parity and real `tools/call`; `CF_ACTION_LOG` deltas proved software happy path and fail-closed hardware/error edges.
